# Conic Palace - robot control center (WIP)

(see https://github.com/dossalab/conic first)

This is a sample control application for robot arm.

## Building

We use go modules now, so fear not - you don't need to care much about GOPATH. Just execute `go mod vendor` to populate libraries and then `go build` - that should be it.
